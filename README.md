I am researching how we can capture and generate photorealistic human face avatars, as a PhD student at Imperial College London.
Currently working as a Researcher in Computer Vision, at Huawei UK R&D. I have studied Computer Science and Innovation Management at Imperial College London, UCL and AUEB.
