### Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alexandros Lattas

I am researching how we can capture and generate photorealistic human face avatars, as a PhD student at Imperial College London.

I have studied Computer Science and Innovation Management at Imperial College London, University College London and the Athens University of Economics and Business.

Currently working as a Researcher in Computer Vision, at Huawei UK R&D.
